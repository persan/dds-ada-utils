# DDS Ada Utils
Contains a set of utility packages that could be used to simplify programing patterns.

The patters are:
* A message queue pattern with a client sending data to a server in a reliable way.
** Note the intent is to make messeging stupid simple.
* An home build request response pattern, use the "standard" DDS request response pattern instead.
